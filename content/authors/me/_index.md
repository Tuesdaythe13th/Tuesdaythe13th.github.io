Tuesday (Claudia Ramirez) is the Founder and Director of Research at **ARTIFEX Labs**, focusing on AI safety, mechanistic interpretability, multi-agent systems, and quantum-adjacent advanced computing.

Her work centers on **AI safety, mechanistic interpretability, and socio-technical risk analysis** across agentic, multimodal, and quantum-adjacent systems. This includes clinical diagnostic frameworks for AI behavioral pathologies (SCAI risk, epistemic coercion, dissociative reasoning), circuit-level interventions, multi-agent evaluation taxonomies, and post-quantum threat modeling.

Tuesday collaborates with **MLCommons, Humane Intelligence, Open Compute Project, Google programs**, academic labs, and public-interest institutions to develop open benchmarks, security metrics, socio-technical taxonomies, and secure-by-design infrastructure.

Her research also includes the **American Emotional Infrastructure (AEI)** project, treating national affect and socio-technical stacks as critical infrastructure with quantum-inspired metrics for stress, trust, and polarization.
