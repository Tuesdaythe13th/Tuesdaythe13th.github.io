The American Emotional Infrastructure (AEI) project treats national affect and socio-technical stacks as critical infrastructure, developing quantum-inspired metrics for stress, trust, and polarization at population scale.

## Vision

Just as we have infrastructure for transportation, energy, and communication, AEI recognizes that collective emotional health and social cohesion represent critical infrastructure requiring systematic monitoring, maintenance, and investment.

## Technical Approach

The project develops novel metrics and measurement frameworks inspired by quantum systems:
- **Entanglement metrics** for measuring social cohesion and polarization
- **Coherence measures** for tracking collective sense-making
- **Stress tensors** for quantifying societal pressure points
- **Phase transition indicators** for identifying critical instabilities

## Applications

AEI frameworks inform:
- Early warning systems for social instability
- Policy interventions for mental health and community resilience
- Design principles for pro-social technology
- National security assessments of socio-cognitive threats

## Interdisciplinary Integration

This work bridges computational social science, quantum-inspired analytics, mental health research, and national security, creating actionable intelligence for building more resilient societies.
