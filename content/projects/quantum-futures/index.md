Research on secure-by-design quantum-adjacent infrastructure, post-quantum cryptography, and advanced compute safety architectures through the Open Compute Project's Future Technologies Initiative.

<!--more-->

## Mission

As quantum computing transitions from research to deployment, we must ensure that the infrastructure supporting these systems is secure-by-design and resilient against emerging threats. This project develops safety standards and architectural patterns for the quantum computing era.

## Research Areas

**Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Developing and evaluating cryptographic systems resistant to quantum attacks, ensuring continuity of secure communications as quantum computers become operational.

**Quantum Error Correction & AI Alignment**: Exploring deep connections between quantum error correction techniques and AI alignment robustness. Work conducted with Google's TQEC (Topological Quantum Error Correction) groups reveals parallel structures between maintaining quantum coherence and maintaining value alignment.

**Cross-Domain Resilience**: Developing security architectures that function across air, land, sea, and orbital environments, ensuring quantum-adjacent infrastructure can operate securely in diverse deployment contexts.

**Quantum-for-Good Applications**: Applying quantum algorithms (QAOA, VQE) to high-impact problems like PFAS bioremediation, demonstrating how quantum computing can address pressing environmental and social challenges.
