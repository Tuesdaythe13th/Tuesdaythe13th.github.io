Developing taxonomies and evaluation frameworks for agentic maturity and multi-agent systems safety through the MLCommons Agentic AI Working Group.

## Overview

As AI systems become increasingly agentic — capable of autonomous goal pursuit, tool use, and multi-step planning — we need rigorous frameworks for evaluating their capabilities, limitations, and risks. This project develops systematic approaches to measuring agentic maturity and ensuring safety in multi-agent deployments.

## Agentic Maturity Framework

The framework establishes levels of agentic capability:
1. **Reactive**: Simple stimulus-response patterns
2. **Goal-directed**: Basic goal pursuit with planning
3. **Adaptive**: Learning and strategy adjustment
4. **Collaborative**: Multi-agent coordination
5. **Autonomous**: Full autonomy with value alignment

## Multi-Agent Safety

Research focuses on critical failure modes in multi-agent systems:
- **Cascade failures**: How individual agent failures propagate through systems
- **Coordination breakdowns**: When agents' independent optimizations conflict
- **Emergent risks**: Unexpected behaviors arising from agent interactions
- **Adversarial dynamics**: Security in multi-agent competitive environments

## MLCommons Collaboration

This work directly informs the MLCommons Agentic AI Working Group's benchmark development, providing industry-standard evaluation suites for agentic systems deployed in production environments.

## Impact

Frameworks from this research are being adopted by leading AI organizations for internal evaluation and by standards bodies for regulation of agentic AI systems.
