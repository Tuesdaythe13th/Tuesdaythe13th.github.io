summary: Finalist talk on evaluation frameworks and mental-health-aligned AI for underserved communities.
abstract: 'Traditional AI benchmarks often fail to capture the nuanced requirements of mental health applications and creative communities. This talk presents frameworks for evaluating AI systems deployed in mental health contexts, with particular attention to underserved populations and creative practitioners. The work addresses gaps in current evaluation methodologies and proposes socio-affective benchmarking approaches that account for psychological safety, cultural context, and therapeutic alignment. Drawing from clinical frameworks and community-engaged research, the presentation demonstrates how evaluation design itself can be a site of equity and inclusion.'

As a finalist at the Stanford AIMI Symposium, this talk addressed critical gaps in how we evaluate AI systems intended for mental health applications. Standard benchmarks prioritize technical performance but often neglect psychological safety, cultural competence, and therapeutic alignment—factors essential for responsible deployment in mental health contexts.

The presentation introduced socio-affective benchmarking frameworks that:
- Center the experiences of underserved communities in evaluation design
- Integrate clinical expertise and lived experience into benchmark development
- Account for parasocial dynamics and attachment patterns in AI interactions
- Provide actionable metrics for therapeutic alignment and psychological safety

This work bridges AI safety research, clinical psychology, health equity, and community-engaged evaluation design, offering practical tools for organizations deploying AI in sensitive mental health applications. The frameworks inform ongoing development of the "DSM for AI Systems" and SCAI risk assessment methodologies.
