Winner of the UN ITU AI for Good "Future Leaders in Quantum" hackathon, this presentation demonstrated how quantum computing technologies can be directed toward high-impact social and environmental challenges.

The winning submission showcased:
- **PFAS Bioremediation**: Application of QAOA and VQE quantum algorithms to computational chemistry challenges in forever chemical remediation
- **QPIXL Advanced Challenge**: Contributions to quantum algorithm development for practical social impact applications
- **Quantum-for-Good Frameworks**: Methodologies for ensuring quantum computing development prioritizes humanitarian and environmental applications
- **Cross-Domain Integration**: Connections between quantum error correction research and AI alignment robustness

This work, conducted through collaborations with Google Quantum AI and XPRIZE, demonstrates how emerging quantum technologies can be steered toward addressing urgent global challenges in environmental health, climate resilience, and computational social science.

The recognition from UN ITU AI for Good validates the approach of combining cutting-edge quantum research with urgent social needs, informing ongoing work through the Open Compute Project's Future Technologies Initiative on secure-by-design quantum infrastructure.
