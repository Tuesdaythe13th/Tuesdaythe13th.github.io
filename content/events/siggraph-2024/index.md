summary: Frontier talk proposing aspirational gameplay as a design pattern for non-exploitative AI-powered games.
abstract: 'This talk proposes aspirational gameplay as a design pattern for creating AI-powered video games that improve mental hygiene and support behavior change, rather than exploiting psychological vulnerabilities for engagement. Drawing from research on anti-addiction design, digital equity, and therapeutic AI, the presentation demonstrates how game design can shift from extractive to aspirational paradigms. Applications include mental health support, patient care improvement, and habit formation that respects human agency and wellbeing.'

This SIGGRAPH 2024 Frontiers talk presented a novel framework for game design that prioritizes human wellbeing over engagement metrics. Aspirational gameplay represents a shift from extractive design patterns (dark patterns, infinite scroll, addiction mechanics) to systems that support users' authentic goals and mental health.

The talk drew from ARTIFEX Labs research on anti-addiction AI, therapeutic interpretability, and digital equity to propose concrete design patterns for AI-powered games that:
- Support meaningful behavior change aligned with users' values
- Respect cognitive and emotional boundaries
- Provide scaffolding for skill development and self-efficacy
- Create positive feedback loops that enhance rather than exploit psychological needs

Applications span mental health support, rehabilitation, chronic disease management, and habit formation, demonstrating how AI can be deployed in gaming contexts to genuinely improve human flourishing.
