Honored to have won the UN ITU AI for Good **"Future Leaders in Quantum"** hackathon! This recognition validates our work at the intersection of quantum computing and high-impact social challenges.

## The Project

Our winning submission demonstrated quantum computing applications for environmental and social impact, with particular focus on:

### PFAS Bioremediation
Applied **QAOA** (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) and **VQE** (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) to computational chemistry challenges in "forever chemical" remediation. PFAS contamination represents one of the most pressing environmental health crises, and quantum algorithms offer potential breakthroughs in identifying remediation pathways.

### QPIXL Advanced Challenge
Contributed to quantum algorithm development for practical social impact applications through the QPIXL advanced challenge, demonstrating how quantum computing can move from theoretical promise to real-world humanitarian applications.

### Quantum Error Correction ↔ AI Alignment
Explored fascinating connections between quantum error correction techniques and AI alignment robustness. Work with Google's TQEC (Topological Quantum Error Correction) groups revealed parallel structures between maintaining quantum coherence and maintaining value alignment in AI systems—both involve preserving delicate informational structures against environmental noise and perturbations.

## Why Quantum for Good Matters

As quantum computing transitions from research to deployment, it's critical that we intentionally direct these powerful technologies toward addressing urgent global challenges. The quantum-for-good movement ensures that:
- Research priorities reflect humanitarian needs
- Access to quantum resources supports public interest applications
- Quantum workforce development includes diverse communities
- Ethical considerations guide quantum technology deployment

## Collaboration & Support

This work was conducted through collaborations with:
- **Google Quantum AI**: Access to quantum processors and TQEC research groups
- **XPRIZE**: Convergence Cohort Leadership providing resources and community
- **ARTIFEX Labs**: Coordinating decentralized research teams across quantum and AI safety

The recognition from UN ITU AI for Good amplifies the message that cutting-edge quantum research can and should address humanity's most pressing challenges.

## What's Next

Continuing quantum futures research through the [Open Compute Project's Future Technologies Initiative](/projects/quantum-futures/), focusing on:
- Secure-by-design quantum-adjacent infrastructure
- Post-quantum cryptography standards
- Cross-domain resilience (air/land/sea/orbital)
- Quantum methods for mental hygiene and social resilience

Excited to continue building bridges between quantum computing, AI safety, and social impact!
