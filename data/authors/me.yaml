bio: |
  Tuesday is the Founder and Director of Research at ARTIFEX Labs, an independent, decentralized R&D and safety engineering studio
  working across mechanistic interpretability, adversarial robustness, evaluation design, multi-agent safety, and quantum-adjacent
  advanced computing. Their work integrates human factors, clinical-style diagnostics, cognitive-affective modeling, and national-scale
  resilience frameworks into standards, benchmarks, and playbooks for frontier and deployed AI systems.

  They collaborate with MLCommons, Humane Intelligence, the Open Compute Project, Google programs, academic labs, and public-interest
  institutions to develop open benchmarks, security metrics, socio-technical taxonomies, and secure-by-design infrastructure. The broader
  practice combines AI safety engineering with cultural production, policy, and narrative design to address real-world harms in health,
  security, mental health, and digital equity.
